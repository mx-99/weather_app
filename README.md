This repository is a deployment of the weather app  from The Odin Project. It contains the dist folder that was built and bundled using Webpack and is deployed to GitHub Pages.

[Weather Forecast App Demo](https://mx-99.github.io/weather_app/dist/) 

The original code and development for the project reside in the main branch of my other repository [my odin projects](https://github.com/mx-99/my_odin_projects/tree/main/full_stack/weather_app)
where this repo is used to serve the live site.
